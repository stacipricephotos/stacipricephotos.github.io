                    <p>"I have met and worked with Staci on 3 shoots she has always been profession and reliable for my makeup and model work. She’s a free spirit kind of person with great humor. If I am ever in the area again I wouldn't hesitate to call her up and do some work together again." ~Gene Paul Thompson- Modeling Shots- Body Painting</p>

					<p>"I love Staci's work. She shot a model of mine and I will definitely go back to her. She is professional and makes you feel very comfortable. She knows how to capture your beauty at its best :) If you want exceptional photos, Staci is your photographer! Thanks Staci." ~LaToya Nubia Carlton- Co-Owner/CEO Encore Talent Agency- Modeling Shots</p>

					<p>"Staci was the answer to my prayers. I had been hunting high and low for a photographer who was reasonably priced and didn't look at me like I was in crazy when I said I was having a Halloween/costume wedding. I knew she was the photographer to have from the minute we met. She is very professional and my photos are BEAUTIFUL! Staci you are the best!" ~Beth’s Halloween Wedding</p>

					<p>"Staci has a great eye for seeing a shot. She took amazing shots of the tangibles....cake, flowers, decor. The candid shots are even more impressive; she caught the reactions and the smiles. Wonderful!!! You are a pleasure to work with, Thanks so much!!!!" ~Jayne’s Wedding</p>

					<p>"Staci traveled approximately two hours to our wedding venue and took some of the most fabulous pictures I have ever seen. She was pleasant and truly captured our special evening with our family and friends. Her pricing was reasonable and well matched with the quality." ~Stephanie’s Wedding</p>

					<p>"Staci did a great job getting good shots of our uncooperative 2 year old. We also loved that we only had to pay a little extra to get the CD with printing rights to the photos, so we can enjoy the pictures forever!" ~Rachel’s Child Portraits</p>

					<p>"Friendly people and excellent pictures! The one thing that I did not have to worry about on our wonderful day was the pictures. Staci was awesome and got great photos. The services were extremely affordable and were within our limited budget. We were also able to get the photos, with permission, and are able to print the photos that we want for ourselves and for our family. They are HIGHLY recommended!" ~Cristin’s Wedding</p>

					<p>"Staci photographed my wedding. Working on tight budget she was affordable and took great pictures. Instead of having us print pictures, she gives a CD with printing rights (we like this so we can go through and print the ones we like, as many times as we like). The pictures all came out beautiful. UPDATE: We used Staci again for our first set of maternity photos in October, and absolutely love them. They came out beautiful. She did a wonderful job and always makes us feel comfortable. Thank you once again Staci!!!!" ~Ashley’s Wedding</p>

					<p>"Staci is very professional, friendly and talented. Most recently, she photographed our newborn. The pictures came out beautiful. Staci was patient as always with our baby who was fussy during the shoot she made it work and we were very happy with the results. She is affordable and flexible. She also did our wedding and maternity pictures which came out wonderful as well! Highly recommend, you will be happy with the shoot and photos!!!" ~Ashley’s Newborn Session</p>

					<p>"Staci did an absolutely wonderful job for my project. She is very professional and creative. I would recommend her to anyone wanted to create those lasting memories." ~2012 Portrait Session</p>

					<p>"Amazing work! Staci did an absolutely amazing job with my three kids she was professional and very patient. Can't wait to use her again!" ~Carey’s Child Portraits</p>

					<p>"Excellent job! Professional, Creative, Talented & Qualified. I will definitely utilize her services again in the future. ~Gus’ Portraits</p>
