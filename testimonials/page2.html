                        <p>"Great value, great service and amazing pictures. We truly enjoyed Staci's professional attitude and her ability to keep us at ease through the full process. We received our photos from Staci about a week after our photo shot and they were all fantastic photos." ~Mike’s Portraits</p>

                        <p>"Staci did an amazing job with my " mommy n me" photos. She was very patient with my 2 year old. Staci was able to capture the love between a mother and daughter." ~Christyn’s Mommy n’ Me Photos</p>

                        <p>"Staci did an excellent job on my head shot photos. I must say that I really enjoy the photography experience with Staci. She is very professional, and nice. And my photos came out really well. I was very impressed with her work. I also received my pictures very quickly on a cd with printing rights... I will definitely use her again. ~Michelle’s Headshots</p>

                        <p>"Used Staci for an hour shoot. She made it fun and comfortable. Price was definitely worth it and pictures came back great! ~2011 Portrait Session</p>
                        
                        <p>"Staci did a fabulous job with our family photos. There were 11 of us and she was able to get so many great shots! She was patient and made us laugh. We had a lot of fun! Her prices are reasonable and we received the CD very quickly. Thanks Staci!" ~Melissa’s Family Portraits</p>

                        <p>"Staci is a pleasure to work with! I am an event planner, and have Staci take my portfolio pictures. She does an amazing job. I love my pictures!" ~Laurie’s Event Photos</p>

                        <p>"Staci did an amazing job on our daughter's head shots. The images were terrific, the location she chose was great. Staci was pleasant and professional. One of the best photographers I have worked with. Thanks Staci" ~Laney’s Portraits</p>

                        <p>"I really enjoyed working with Staci. It was my first wedding and she helped me alot. I had many questions and she was very patient with me as well. My pictures are great and we have enjoyed looking at them many times since our wedding." ~April Wedding</p>

                        <p>"Staci did a wonderful job capturing our wedding day. As a new mom with a 7 week old son at the time of my wedding the last thing I needed was to stress about my wedding day. I contacted Staci just a few weeks prior to my wedding and thankfully she was available and I was more than pleased with her service as well as our photos. She was very easy to work with and did a great job of keeping our large wedding party on task. As I was looking through our photos, I couldn't help but notice that she had
                        captured almost every one of our guest walking into the church and we had a pretty large guest list. I would highly recommend Staci for your upcoming event as her sweet demeanor, patience, reasonable prices and quality results make her a #1 pick. I plan to use her in the future for our family photos. :)" ~Ershlena’s Wedding</p>

                        <p>"Staci's work was done in an extremely professional manner. Our photo shoot was of my boyfriend in uniform with an American flag in the background and me in a red dress (to remember his time in the Army since he just completed his duty). My favorite shot was us making a heart with our arms in front of the flag- very creative (Staci's idea). She makes you feel comfortable and gives you lots of suggestions and poses so that you get your hours worth. We received the prints in the mail promptly and had them all framed and hung in our living room. We get compliments all the time. Beautiful photos. Very pleased." ~Katie and Wesley’s Portraits</p>

                        <p>"Very kind and professional photographer. She came to my home to take pictures of my 6 month old son. The pictures came out fantastic. We did indoor and outdoor pictures. When I got the proofs, they were wonderful. She had color, black and white, and special effect proofs. I would use her again and highly recommend her." ~Jennifer’s Child Portraits</p>

                        <p>"Wow! I am happy I choose Staci for our wedding day, I love all the funny moments that she captured, she also very professional and we were shocked at some of the pictures that she had taken and we didn’t even notice. I’m glad I found someone to put the pictures on a disc and choose which ones to print out on my own rather than having a thousand images that i wouldn’t know to do with. Awesome Job!" ~2011 Wedding</p>

                        <p>"Staci Price photographed our wedding. The photos turned out great with a good mix of candid and planned shots. We appreciated the tiered pricing and the fact that Staci provided a CD of all of our wedding photos. Staci is professional and personable. We relied on her expertise in wedding photography and were very satisfied with her service." ~Marilyn’s Wedding</p>

                        <p>"Staci was great! She got some fabulous pictures of my family! I will definitely go back to her!" ~Family Portrait Session</p>

                        <p>“We recently had Stacy take our family pictures at Pullen Park and she definitely exceeded our expectations. She was very professional and patient as we had a cranky one year old who didn't want to cooperate. But she managed to take great pictures. We will definitely use her again. ~Melissa’s Family Photos</p>

                        <p>"YOU, my dear, did a FANTASTIC job! I cannot believe you were able to get such great pictures with the humidity killing my hair and Chance almost snoozing. I cannot thank you enough for this cheer today and for the forever captured memories of Chance's 6 month birthday. We will definitely be seeing you again." ~Velvet Family Portrait Session</p>

                        <p>"My husband and I are new to the area.  We thought for sure it would be almost impossible to find a professional photographer at a reasonable price that was actually good.  Staci Price is excellent!!!  We hired her to take maternity photos.  Staci is a patient, caring, and kind person with an excellent sense of creativity and professionalism.  We were very impressed by how well our pictures turned out.  We will definitely be using her again when our little one finally gets here.  :)  I will be recommending her to anyone and everyone needing a photographer." ~Nikki’s Maternity Photos</p>

                        <p>"Any one who has ever spent time around a two year old or a 3 month old understands they don't have a slow moment! Staci was great! She was prepared to get down and dirty to get the good pictures, even falling over at one point just to get the shot! She worked with our whole family to help us get the best possible pictures. I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for great shots! The best part: We got to choose our own location!" ~Anne’s Family Portrait Session</p>

                        <p>"I can't say enough great things about Staci and the photos she captures! She is wonderful with my two young daughters and always catches their personalities and gets fabulous photos!! ~Michelle’s Xmas and 4 Year Old Photos</p>

                        <p>"My family and I have talked about having family pictures done for the last 4 years. Once we finally decided to have them done, there was the chore of finding a good photographer. I am so glad that we were able to find a great photographer. Staci was very patient and professional (first appointment had to be canelled due to weather) and the photos were beautiful. We will definitely use Staci again in the future." ~Dee Dee's Family Portraits</p>

                        <p>"Staci did a great job with our newborn/family pictures. She is professional and was very patient while my newborn was waking up and fussy and still able to capture some great shots. We are very grateful to be able to capture this very special time for our family. Thank you Staci and we look forward to working with you again!!" ~Julie's Newborn Photos</p>
